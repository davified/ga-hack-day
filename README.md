# GA Hack Day

## The Big Idea
A two-day hackathon for developers (GA-grads only?) to get together, build solutions, learn stuff and have fun!

Here's the general plan (so far):

### Key objectives of the hackathon
* Everyone should have fun
* Everyone should come out of the hackathon learning a new programming technology/paradigm
* Generate solutions for business/social problems

### Details
* Date: 12 November 2016 (Sat, 9am) - 13 November 2016 (Sun, 9pm)
* Venue: TBC (preferentially a startup with lots of space for group work, coffee/beer and bean bags)

### How it'll work
* [Jeremiah's idea] On Day 1, participants will be randomly assigned a front-end framework (Angular, React, Ember, Meteor, Backbone, Rails) or back-end framework (Express, Laravel, Yii). The random assignment can be done at 9am when everyone's in the room, for transparency. The use of the assigned framework is not compulsory, but it'll increase the group's final score by x %.
* Participants can either come as a group, or form a group on the spot. Each group can have a maximum of 4 members.
* From 10am onwards, groups can start work and

### Judging criteria (20 points for each criteria)
* Good development practices (we can further define what defines 'good' - e.g. testing, UX, OOP, etc.)
* Relevance of solution to the problem statement established by the group
* Novelty / creativity of the solution
* The total number of votes received (Each participant gets n/2 votes, where n represents the number of groups. (We'll need to build a webpage for voting))
* Contributions to social / business needs

### Logistics (what we need)
* Food (breakfast, lunch, dinner)
* Snacks (bread, nuts, fruits, etc)
* Drinks (beer, coffee, water)
* Working space (tables, power points, couches)
* Strong wifi
* A GA Hack Day webpage for (i) hosting information and schedule, (ii) generating random group assignments, (iii) voting by participants, (iv) communicating with the organisers.
