# GA Hack Day

## The Big Idea

A one-day hackathon for developers (WDI grads, UX grads, and friends are welcome!) to get together, mingle over food and drinks, learn from each other and guest speakers, build solutions and have fun!

What we've decided on after the first meeting:

### Theme: The Mothership X Smart Nation

- During the hackathon, participants will form groups and each group will build an app / microservice that will feed into a single mega mothership app.
- The mothership app could be a dashboard that expose endpoints to microservices that provide solutions in areas such as:

  - Technology
  - Data analytics
  - AI
  - Healthcare
  - Jobs
  - Startups
  - Business productivity
  - Education
  - Transport
  - Fitness
  - Whatever else the participants can come up with!

- We can provide the above categories/buckets as an initial starting point for participants. They will be responsible for coming up with the problem statement and deciding on their implementation strategy. There can be more than one group in a category/bucket, and participants are welcome to add new categories/buckets (so long as they build it in a group)

- To encourage the fun aspect and to prevent people from getting overly competitive, there won't be a "winner" per se. There will be prizes/goodies (e.g. GA course credits, co-working space vouchers)

- This theme / approach is cool because:

  - It is technically challenging and (if done well) impressive
  - It encourages collaboration within teams and across microservices
  - The outcomes will be open-sourced and it can benefit businesses, the social sector and the general public.
  - The 'smart nation' theme could be a good hook for press coverage. Press coverage will benefit GA grads, GA, and future GA students!

### Key objectives of the hackathon

- Participants should have fun
- The hackathon should raise awareness about General Assembly and GA grads
- The hackathon should stimulate learning
- Generate solutions for business/social problems

### Details

- Date: TBC
- Time: 9am - 10pm
- Venue: Spacemob

### Why come? (pull factors)

The hackathon will be an opportunity for GA grads to:

- mingle, get together, catch up, meet other developers (psst potential employers)
- build something / implement an idea in a day
- learn from each other and from guest talks
- have fun!

### Schedule (as of now)

> Hourly "Pomodoro" lightning talks (10-15mins) will be taking place at the cafe. The number of talks will depend on the number of guest speakers we can find. I've allocated the events to a timeslot to help us better visualise the program. These are tentative timeslots and can be changed further.

Time             |                                                               Activity

~~### Judging criteria (20 points for each criteria)~~

~~- Good development practices (we can further define what defines 'good' - e.g. testing, UX, OOP, etc.)~~ ~~- Relevance of solution to the problem statement established by the group~~ ~~- Novelty / creativity of the solution~~ ~~- The total number of votes received (Each participant gets n/2 votes, where n represents the number of groups. (We'll need to build a webpage for voting))~~ ~~- Contributions to social / business needs~~

### Logistics (what we need)

- Food (breakfast, lunch, dinner)
- Snacks (bread, nuts, fruits, etc)
- Drinks (beer, coffee, water)
- Working space (tables, power points, couches)
- Strong wifi
- A GA Hack Day webpage for (i) hosting information and schedule, (ii) generating random group assignments, (iii) voting by participants, (iv) communicating with the organisers.
- Prizes (e.g. GA course credits, co-working space vouchers, etc.)

### To do

Here's a list of stuff that I (David) came up with after the meeting:

- Pitch idea to Aziza and GA staff
- Finalise date
- Advertise about the event on facebook, within our WDI.x group chats and at meetups
- Get 4-5 guest speakers + a keynote speaker (ideally someone respectable in the dev community)
- Book the venue with Spacemob
- Run by the programme with somebody super detail-oriented (**ahem** Rachel **ahem**) to check if we've covered all grounds
